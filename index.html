				<p>	during the great gathering on mars in 2718, the fate of earth was decided in a game of rock paper scissors. the interplanetary delegates assembled had been in talks for days prior to the final clinch fisted blow<br/><br/>
				eson, son of jam, was at the time the most respected interplanetary explorer and the long standing ambassador of earth to the furthest galaxies. to humans he was the invisible ether that bound entire systems together by his very name. such was the power of eson, son of jam. when the final fist had fallen, eson stood victorious, but not relishing in his victory, he took to his knee, bowed his head and said "<em>to none... but all... <strong>forever</strong></em>" <br/><br/>
				these words marked the end of a love story in the solar season. earth was evacuated under a new intergalactic treaty and declared an h-free system. for the next 10 000 years, no human being would inhabit the earth, all other lifeforms would be left to flourish by the will of time and any manner of structure or system would remain as they lay. religion's final tombstone, laid to rest<br/><br/>

				<h1>the story never ends</h1><br />
				<p>many flying species survived the great cleansing, many early humans too, one such family was <small>shuuk</small> and <small>suddah's</small>, coastal foragers sleeping high in the mountains. there were very little flying flesh eaters in their lands for long periods of moons, and there was enough food every where, everyday, all the time</p>
				<p>the mountain's cliff is what created and sustained their little microclimate, shielding them from the noxious gases spread across the planet... the shape of the shoreline, the heights of the flanking mountains, the spume of the surf and all the energies of the mountain came together to provide a sort of safe zone for him and his extended family, neighbours and some visitors. the south of the planet holds many secrets, one of them an entrance to a core cave system, an eden discovered by accident one day while diving for giant shell grabbers, zappos as they were named</p>
				<p><small>wuuko</small>, <small>suddah's</small> second cousin went down into the water, past the last barrier of rocks, the shell grabber spots him and does a speedy dive, <small>wuuko</small> follows him down quickly, he kicks hard and points straight, but there was really no where for the zappo to swim, and as if it had pushed through the sand, it just kept going down and down... with very little breath left he courageously follows the zappo further down... he kicks, pushes harder, starts using his hands, almost within reach, and then, as if entering a rock shaped chimney that seems to be lit from above, he follows the zappo up... he glides all the way to the top, and there it was... <span class="b i">incredible</span>... the entrance to an underground network of caves that stretches in different directions for what seems like forever, fresh water, green flora and a light as bright as day</p>
				<p><small>wuuko</small> swims cautiously toward the cave's shore and looks around, and up and down, it seemed impossible what he was seeing, a cave garden complete with fresh water and food ready to move in to. he couldn't understand how the light was coming in, how it was so lit, so luminous... he decides to return to <small>shuuk</small> and bring back some others to see and experience this amazing find... on their return, their faces reflected their thoughts... the fearless <small>aakhtee</small> starts a sprint down one of the cave's tunnel openings until he disappeared into the distance, eventually stopping he loudly shouts <span class="i">"kah poo lee lee... kah poo leeeeeeee"</span> and they all start laughing, almost quietly, as if to themselves...</p><br/><br/>

					<small id="readme" style="font-size: 11px;"><b style="font-size: 12px">README&nbsp;</b> this is a kak long story... it's the distillation of lessons I've been teaching at schools across the cape flats, but on the low, because there are people that allow love to flow and those who prevent it. I've covered about 70 primary &amp; high schools, a few colleges, call centers &amp; some factories. I use vernacular and profanity as a way to dress the analogies and convey the essence, like a show, mostly for the lighties.. I've been teaching for a few years now, no media coverage, no audio or video recordings, no fees, nothing like that still, this is a other buzz, for the lighties mos... every week I spend a few hours infiltrating the baby-sitting services masquerading as educational institutions. twelve years spent in a schooling system that leaves you worth no more than R10 p/h &amp; you evens get a certificate to prove it... it helps if you read this story with something to write with, it helps to draw as you read along, try it, you have nothing to lose, but aweh... <br/><br/> <a href="#" onclick="$('#the-seven-nommers').fadeIn(2000); this.style.display='none';  event.preventDefault(); $('#readme').fadeOut(1000)" style="font-size: 16px;">show me the story</a> </small>
				</p>

				<p id="the-seven-nommers" style="display: none">lets for the purpose of discussion<br/>
					take one dollar &amp; one thought<br/>
					the dollar as commodity, has a limit<br/>
					the thought as commodity, is limitless<br/>
					but most value the dollar more than the thought<br/><br/>

					thought is the fundamental building block of life<br/>
					it shapes our physical reality<br/>
					whether you understand it<br/>
					or believe it, or not<br/><br/>

					a thought lives forever<br/>
					you cannot kill a thought<br/>
					all my thoughts<br/>
					and all your thoughts<br/>
					live in the space<br/>
					called the collective<br/>
					the collective is just another name<br/>
					for the moerse bakkie<br/>
					where all our thoughts live<br/>
					its essentially the place <br/>
					where god accesses all our thoughts<br/>
					we all feed the collective<br/>
					and all feed off of it<br/>
					if I have a kak gedagte<br/>
					I am essentially poisoning the water hole<br/>
					that we all feed from<br/><br/>

					as you are reading these words<br/>
					as the words are imprinted onto your mind<br/>
					there are thoughts streaming to you<br/>
					life and direct, 24/7/365<br/>
					you cannot shut it down<br/>
					its a by product of being alive<br/>
					even now as you are reading <br/>
					those thoughts are still streaming to you<br/>
					you make peace with this stream<br/>
					or you get carried away with it<br/><br/>

					the average high school girl<br/>
					uses up to 60 percent<br/>
					of her thought capacity<br/>
					to judge the next girl and herself<br/>
					she's sitting at home, in her room<br/>
					zoning on the other girls hair, her nails, her bag<br/>
					the girl she's zoning on<br/>
					is not even in the room with her...<br/>
					this is the very essence of giving krag weg<br/>
					allowing one's thoughts to run rampant<br/>
					out of control<br/>
					if she valued her thoughts<br/> 
					like she valued her dollars<br/>
					she's not going to be zoning on that girl<br/>
					for an hour, a day, a whole fucking lifetime<br/>
					are you jas?<br/><br/>

					look at what she's doing<br/>
					more than 50% of her thoughts<br/>
					for a 24 hour period<br/>
					was occupied on thoughts of judgement<br/>
					heavy days bra...<br/>
					she could have been thinking<br/>
					my mom is happy<br/>
					my brother is safe<br/>
					my life is good<br/>
					green grass, blue skies, HOPA!<br/>
					but she can't control her thoughts<br/>
					so she gets on that bus<br/>
					only to arrive an hour later<br/>
					at the same place she found herself before<br/><br/>

					to take stock of this young lady's thoughts<br/>
					we need to demonstrate how we concluded the 50%+<br/>
					we claim she had been using exclusively on<br/> judgement<br/>
					of the self mainly, through comparison to the other<br/><br/>

					there are these little metrics<br/>
					imagine an upside down "T"<br/>
					the vertical axis represents<br/>
					the state of being<br/>
					the horizontal axis represents<br/>
					the state of becoming<br/><br/>

					each of these metrics<br/>
					of which there are many<br/>
					represent the anchor points<br/>
					for the polarities<br/>
					in other words<br/>
					a single upside down "T"<br/> 
					represents the opposites<br/>
					so, for example<br/>
					love and hate is one thing<br/>
					love is on the left of the horizontal axis<br/>
					and hate represents the right of the horizontal axis<br/>
					love and hate is one thing<br/>
					on the same line<br/>
					they bleed into each other<br/>
					like hot and cold<br/>
					you are either becoming hate<br/>
					or becoming love<br/>
					based on the mental, physical and spiritual stuff<br/>
					that are effecting you everyday<br/><br/>

					everything on the left is positive<br/>
					or a high vibrational frequency<br/>
					like courage<br/>
					everything on the right is negative<br/>
					or a low vibrational frequency<br/>
					life fear<br/>
					everything on the left is essentially<br/>
					smiley face<br/>
					everything on the right is essentially<br/>
					sad face<br/><br/>

					did you ever go to a place<br/>
					maybe someone's home<br/>
					and maybe think to yourself while being there<br/>
					"I don't feel like being here,<br/> 
					it doesn't feel right here"<br/>
					that feeling, is you experiencing<br/>
					the thoughts of those person(s)<br/>
					through the vibration they are emmitting<br/>
					my thought, sustains my vibration<br/>
					when you are sitting at home<br/>
					feeling mad or sad<br/>
					the chances are 100% <br/>
					that what you are thinking about<br/>
					is what is making you feel that way<br/>
					there's no other nommer...<br/>
					the trees don't know how to lie<br/>
					when a forest grows<br/>
					its like a giant truth made of love<br/>
					that's why it feels lekker to walk through the forest<br/><br/>

					at the center<br/>
					of becoming either love or hate<br/>
					is the state of being, oneness<br/>
					its essentially one love<br/>
					I prefer to call it one love<br/>
					I feel it conceited<br/>
					for me to think<br/>
					that I know the name of god<br/>
					to illustrate, take romeo and juliet<br/>
					romeo and juliet are sitting under a tree<br/>
					romeo is trying to explain to juliet<br/>
					who and what shakespeare is<br/>
					but how can romeo possibly conceive of<br/>
					who are what shakespeare is<br/>
					if he himself<br/>
					was conceived in the mind of shakespeare<br/>
					its an old analogy, to convey the conceit<br/>
					in me trying to explain to you<br/>
					who and what god is<br/><br/>

					for the purposes of discussion<br/>
					let us say that there are two types of love<br/>
					the one type of love, is the opposite of hate<br/>
					like, I'm in love, I'm out of love<br/>
					the other love<br/>
					lies at the center of becoming 
					either love and hate<br/> 
					on the axis of being<br/>
					this love is essentially one love<br/>
					undifferentiated, unconditional love<br/>
					one love does not look less favourbly<br/>
					on the cheetah<br/>
					who killed the young buck<br/>
					to feed her cubs...<br/>
					are you happy for the cheetah?<br/>
					or sad for the buck?<br/>
					"one love", is indifferent to such things<br/>
					nothing is personal, everything is energy<br/>
					there is nothing happening to you<br/>
					its just happening<br/>
					some people go through an entire lifetime<br/>
					without concluding this <br/>
					even as a possibility<br/><br/>

					if you can see the upside down "T" still in your mind<br/>
					with love and courage etc on the left<br/>
					and hate and fear etc on the right<br/>
					the H-axis as the state of becoming<br/>
					the V-axis as the state of being<br/>
					with that in mind<br/>
					introduce now a new dimension of time<br/>
					separated by hour<br/>
					as a third dimension<br/>
					to denote when I was feeling how<br/><br/>

					so, for example<br/>
					6am, 7am, 8am, 9am etc etc<br/>
					with this new dimension of time added<br/>
					we'll be able to plot and track<br/>
					and clearly see for how long<br/>
					I've been either hovering on the love side<br/>
					or on the hate side...for a 24 hour period<br/>
					so, using myself as an example<br/>
					I will plot myself<br/>
					on the metric of love and hate<br/>
					to illustrate how I am moved from pole to pole<br/>
					during the day, as and when things affect me<br/><br/>

					so, at 6am I get up<br/>
					i'm usually in a happy state<br/>
					so I plot myself a little on the love side<br/>
					just slightly to the left of the axis of being<br/>
					at 7am I put on some lekker beats<br/>
					raising my vibration<br/>
					causing me to plot myself even further left<br/>
					at 8am, my mom calls me and tells me to come and fetch some fresh koesiesters<br/>
					I obviously go and fetch a moerse bakkie of koesiesters<br/>
					plotting myself now all the way to the left on the love side<br/>
					at 9am, my brother calls, and tells me that he's just written off the car<br/>
					now, this will send most into a state<br/>
					but I pause and say to him<br/>
					don't worry about the fliping car<br/>
					are you okay?<br/>
					doing this keeps me relatively centered<br/>
					preventing me from sliding over to a state of hate<br/>
					and I plot myself just a little to the left<br/>
					of the vertical-axis, still on the love side<br/><br/>

					the average high school girl cannot control her thoughts<br/>
					she is sold to the highest distraction<br/>
					allowing her vibration to shift from love to hate,<br/>
					she is moved back and forth and back again <br/>
					almost without her consent<br/>
					she cannot focus her thought<br/>
					she has not yet mastered <br/>
					the discipline of focus<br/><br/>

					when I lay in bed at night<br/>
					and take stock of my thoughts<br/>
					if I am sincere with myself<br/>
					I will know for how long <br/>
					I've been camping out on the love side<br/>
					and why<br/>
					and if I'm sincere with myself<br/>
					I will know for how long <br/>
					I've been camping out on the hate side<br/>
					and why<br/><br/>

					controlling your thoughts is kak hard, its poes hard<br/>
					its the equivalent of trying to work a six pack <br/>
					but for your mind<br/>
					everyone wants the six pack<br/>
					but nobody wants to do the crunches<br/><br/>

					focus is your weapon of choice <br/>
					on this mental battlefield<br/>
					if we take lionel messi as an example<br/>
					his focus is next level<br/>
					we admire his skill<br/>
					but if during a high stakes game<br/>
					he lets a thought<br/>
					of an argument past<br/>
					come into his mind <br/>
					even for a second<br/>
					he can get thrown off his A game<br/><br/>

					if you are totally focused on what you are doing<br/>
					if you are so engrossed with the act<br/>
					with which you are engaged in<br/>
					then, that bad thought, can't come in<br/>
					focus is your weapon of choice<br/>
					focus trains the will of your attention<br/>
					to allow anyone, to achive any goal<br/><br/>

					but aweh<br/>

				<p>it was the first class of the day<br/>
						dylan is distracted<br/>
						trying his best to distract me<br/>
						and the rest of the class<br/>
						he challenges me<br/>
						in the class, but of course<br/>
						I respond with strategically sincere love<br/>
						I pretend to ignore him<br/>
						but he’s persistent<br/>
						so I decide half way into the lesson<br/>
						to teach from the table standing in the front of the class<br/>
						he then, seated in his chair<br/>
						starts sabelaring, quite fluently, as a taunt<br/>
						an invitation, but of course I cannot get on that bus<br/>
						so I offer him one of my half-time speeches<br/>
						I raise my voice &amp; my vibration<br/>
						I push my entire being through my voice<br/>
						and in his direction<br/>
						I make him feel me<br/>
						in no uncertain terms<br/>
						and he does, I can feel him feel me<br/>
						after my five minute speech directed at him<br/>
						but still speaking to the class<br/>
						I tell them<br/>
						"I want yous to have everything<br/>
						a jas house, a jas car, happy times, lekker vibes<br/>
						I want yous to have everything your heart wants<br/>
						I wish... I could give you the world...<br/>
						but I can't... die woorde is al wat ek het..."<br/>
						I told them that I loved them<br/>
						and I meant it and they felt it...<br/>
						and two girls in the back started crying<br/>
						it was a heavy moment and it was beautiful<br/>
						when the siren sounded, dylan stormed out of the class<br/>
						without waiting a second...<br/>
						three periods later<br/>
						our paths cross down one of the corridors<br/>
					  without any of his classmates<br/>
						I see him seeing me see him, and he looks right at me<br/>
						then he walks toward me, puts out his left clinched fist<br/>
						and says "irie king"<br/>
						that might not seem like much to most people<br/>
						but to me, it was as worthy a victory<br/>
						as great as any battle fought in our time<br/>

					"look, I can’t say much"<br/>
					that’s beause he doesn’t know fokkol, but he’s drunk and he wants that feeling of having arranged things on the fly as and when the conversation leads into it... and of course during this time, while he’s having his drunk chatter, he stops the conversation abruptly and says...<br/>

					that "when can you meet us?" at the end was for effect and the benefit of the crowd within earshot<br/>
					plus I skiet him<br/>

					"don't you guys maybe wanna skype?"<br/>

					never heard from him again...<br/>

				<p>a few years ago I met a really nice girl... we clicked &amp; the sex was next level, the energy transfer between us was almost effortless, even the way we argued about simple things felt familiar, as if we’d done it before, but for sure the feeling was not foreign to me, it felt like a home I remembered from a when I can’t recall...<br/><br/>
					we made a pact, we saw each other in secret mostly and we lead seemingly single lives, we were focused on our individualities, we never lived together, sleepovers of course, even weekends, but very discreetly, our connection was not common knowledge and so remained untainted by anything other that what we ourselves tainted it with... but neither of us did any tainting of any kind, we agreed to always lift each other up, or let each other go, this is true love as far as we could see... <br/><br/>

					all I cared about was seeing her flourish and flower into the beauty that she already was, it was like a secret, but a beautiful one, and we cherished it more than any tangible thing in our lives... we developed a bond that is without distance or time, we truly became one, just being ourselves<br/><br/>

		      <p>I spent the entire friday night with her and acted as her runner, she was totally cool with it because her runner which is also her boyfriend was on a side-chick-mish and all she really felt like doing was being horizontal...  her phone’s beeping becomes increasingly and incessantly needy from seven’ish up until just before twelve</p>
		      <br />
		      <p><strong>the customers</strong>, a handful of them anyway... </p>
		      <br />
		      <br />
		      <p><strong>keith</strong>, gavin, chella, drogba, kelly, candice, kelly’s sister, kelly’s sister’s friend and her bestie jade...  no one older than 21...  these guys come with two cars and a circus full of mense to buy half-a-gee, the person in their group in whatsapp contact with my sister orders one gee, so, she sends me out with one gee, I get to the cars and can see a cash count shuffle going on, which includes fifty cent pieces, they tally up seventy rand and tell me, "okay we only want a half rather" I smile and say, "yor bra, but a half is eighty!" – changing coke bottles lying on the backseat’s floor seemed like the next logical step for them, I tell them, "wait gou, I’m gonna go get a halfie" giving them time to get their story together</p>
		      <br />
		      <p><strong>thea</strong>, single, independent and ambitious, late 20’s, call centre manager, looks like she had a tough week or a poes bad day, her hair wasn’t ready to meet me, she’s buying a 50 rand bag of fairly descent outdoor, I tap the passenger window, she’s weary as she doesn’t recognize the runner, I shake the bag of weed through the window and she releases the central locking almost pavlovically – she looks like she really needs to smoke! I flirt with her, she don’t mind, and her initially car-idling haste is veered of course as I dish her some of my bestest mating behaviour, she turns off the ignition and reaches for her cigarettes without taking her eyes off the conversation – I now had an audience – but I ask her only what I need to know, under the cover of the wooing. ten minutes past, I end the conversation and exit the car swiftly. the night was just getting started... </p>

		      <p>I met wayne at the same intersection, everyday, rain or shine, on my way into work, and everyday he wouldn’t ask me for money, he’d ask me for work, without fail, never, not once did he ask for cash, not once. </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>wayne came to cape town from the eastern cape looking for work, money, gold and gifts to take back home to his family, he thought in a few years he’d be leaving cape town with a drop top bmw, a boot full of cash and a jus pair of shades, but the reality he was finding to be much harsher than what he’d expected. the skurrel life is taxing on the soul and the body takes a good few knocks along the way.</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>I watched a young lady shave 10-15 years off her life just by living and sleeping on the street for only 3 years, no warm slippers to push your feet into as you drag them and your half closed eyes to your underfloor heated bathroom with heated toilet seat and double ply toilet paper, but aweh, nobody’s pointing fingers, somebody is just writing words and another person is reading them.</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>so I invite wayne over to my place, not to work but to come chill. I give him my address and tell him that if he can make it to my place anytime saturday morning I’d put together a cv for him, print off like a million copies and try to fire his drive...  we had some beers, i made us a jus lunch, we smoked a spliff and all the while trying not to "inspire" him but to "connect" with him, I told him that if he wanted he could work in the garden every saturday for some extra cash and after about 2 months of that, a friend arranged a space for him in his furniture factory in maitland... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>four months later my buddy calls me saying "kyk hieso, this bru is catching on kak" no-show monday’s, awol-friday’s and drunken master nommers for the rest of the week, but aweh, what could I say, I told my buddy to treat him fairly and obviously he had to let him go, so back to ground zero wayne goes and again is without work for another 7 months this time...  its tough bra, no family to lean on, no real friends, no moral support, man alone...  pretty much</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>he eventually shows up back at my place, saying that he fucked up and that he really needed a job...  its like taking back a cheating husband, you wanna believe the nai, but you mos know – I wys him not to worry and don’t make him feel worse than he already does, I give him better options this time, instead of hand-delivering his fate to him with a number to call – this time he needed to push the stone himself – and push he did, his girlfriend was now pregnant with his second child. he lives in masiphumelele with a friend and she in langa with her mother, the kids are fucking beautiful...  she doesn’t work and at the moment neither does he, but somehow it works</p>

		      </br />
		      <p>he's doing well, he looks like every other new born, only when you strip him down will you notice he has no anus and the bag hanging just outside his tiny belly will connect the dots for any on-looker as to why. his dad says that he just eats and eats because the programming associated with the hardware didn’t download the full update, so the messaging to the brain to stop eating is out of whack. the doctors are going to tear him a new one but until then, its a massive saving on nappies and every time he lets out a fart the little bag attached to his belly inflates and his mom immediately releases the wanting fart...  his name is saqib, and we are experiencing this one love together</p>

		      <p>for many people in the 021 sunday tastes like koesiesters...  every burb has a typical titi serving up coconut drizzled love come sabbath morning, like aunty joghra out in pelican park, her granddaughter in pink pyjamas, is standing in your typical titi’s kitchen, waiting for a freshly dipped batch to be delivered to an old lady 6 doors down, seated and standing are three neighbours but nine plastic containers, as your bowl not your presence represents your place in the queue, I’ve hardly ever seen her need to provide change, the client or container is usually armed with exact cash, there’s a small tv in the kitchen which keeps her clients occupied for the few minutes they’re wafting while waiting, one of her kids has just gotten up and making his way across the passage to what must be the toilet, he gives a very sincere but voiceless smile and wave...  there is not a sign outside her home or in the street...  and still her legend grows...  not every one can make <strong>consistently </strong>lekker koesiesters and this particular morning I decided to pit the three top aunties in pelican park against each other...  I’m on my way to the third aunty in a one kilometer radius that’s making koesiesters this morning, outside her home is a young man, who seems to have arrived directly from his saturday evening, leaning against the low fence of the aunty’s home, stuffing koesiesters into his mouth, gazing into the sunday morning distance, I approach him slowly, with a smile and hit him with "... for most mense in cape town, sunday sieker tastes like koesiesters nuh?" he chews, nods, smiles, swallows and then says "aweh, light us a entjie and then we continue this conversation... "</p>
		      </br />
		      <p>the koesiester sunday league represents the top flight in one of cape town’s oldest pastimes...  and honours once again goes to shaheeda out in woodstock with a landslide victory over her closest rival titi yasmina out in goodwood with a whopping 2145 bakkies during this past sugar season. a total of over 14 000 koesiesters and at R2.50 each that’s about R35K for these past six months, working mostly on sunday mornings between 5 and 10 am...  next season is looking wide open for newcomer joghra climbing to fifth place after a terrible start to her season, when asked if she could grab first place from shaheeda during next season’s drizzle &amp; dip she simply replies "Insha Allah"</p>

		      <br />
		      <p>and after we kill the boer and restore all his injustices, we must travel further into the past to make sure our endeavors are not narrow-minded attempts at feeding our fickle fantasies of transgressions within reach of our grandmother’s eyes...  no...  we must fight a bigger fight than that, one that goes back to transgressions against all humans that have gone before us, billions upon billions of minds and heartbeats, who lay as ashes, forgotten, but only for those who see with eyes alone...  if rhodes must fall, so too must the entire building and erf that is uct, because it was his money that built much of the university, and after the uct erf is flattened, you must flatten rhodes memorial, you must kill his family, the businesses, roads and clinics he built, you must kill all the books he wrote and you must kill his spirit, and when you’re done, without realising that you have killed a piece of yourself, will you feel more alive then, will your reward be just, or will you be just like him, only standing on the other side of your own mirror, looking at him, but seeing yourself...  education should be free, but we should maybe reestablish what exactly education is before we light the fuse... </p>

		      <br />
		      <p>with homes in every province in most countries around the world and privy to a transport network few humans know exist, their new-age technology pales in comparison only to the mastery of their telepathic and kinetic abilities...  their opulent lifestyle surpasses the superficiality of mere brands and as each new-born enters into their world, a planet is gifted to them, ownership transferred by the authority of the gift giver’s will alone...  the real estate game has long since moved off the face of earth into the furthest reaches of our milky way</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>the families never fraternize with the general population, ever, and steer clear of any main stream anything, they are not off the grid as it were, they are beyond the reach of the grid...  this is not a social event, this is a family affair and their opulence has afforded them a view of the planet that leaves no room for day time distractions of any kind...  there is much to conquer</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>chaperons have a lineage treasured and valued as highly as any member of the line. Sara is an exquisite human being, she speaks hundreds of languages fluently, including signing, which she used often as a child with her siblings...  she is skilled across vast philosophies and numerous disciplines...  a chaperon is chosen and gifted as the right hand to every living member of the entire family, it is a life-long bond, a protector of equal caliber, ready to die for the longevity of the line</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>Ojila, is the eighth daughter of Kiel, a six year gap exists between a shaper and line child, an ancient birth rhythm is kept in sync by chaperon families all over the world, there are multiple chaperons to choose from for any one blood child birthed. Sara is the only chaperon to ever be chosen at five years of age because of her undeniable brilliance in all manner of adaptation... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>Poghi is chaperon to Kiel’s wife Oni, she is also Sara’s mom and can outlast anything thrown at her. while growing up Sara’s mom would intercept her thoughts midstream and then say out calmly, "... sara, stop messing with your thoughts... " – it scared her that her mom could see inside her head like that, she remembered being excited at the prospect of being able to do such things to other people one day... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>while a few million humans on earth collectively mourn the death of a super star, Sara and Ojila prepare to leave for the south of the planet and then onto a submarine hike of the trenches close to saint helena...  one of their probes had recently discovered a new cavity just below the crust, closer to the old south end, that leads to a water filled well of unearthly beauty, unlike anything they’d both ever seen before, pure and perfect drinking water almost as old as the earth herself, this would be their second visit but first excavation...  their excitement was in sync</p>

		      <p>when I married this trend had escalated to allowing vagrants to use my home as a pit stop, a shower, shave, and a hot meal with a take-away and whatever else I could help them with. one day one of the guys I was helping had not had a hot shower in so long, he used all the hot water in the geyser, soaking up every last hot drop, the bathroom wreaked of his scent and that’s how she found out. she was like "did somebody take a shower here today?" I was getting sloppy, not cleaning up my tracks like I use to. I couldn’t worm my way out of this one, she was on to me. I told her "yes, he’s a friend I’m trying to help, he’s just going through a bad patch" she says "but where does he live, why does he need to shower here?" quite a reasonable question I thought and I was like "he’s homeless" she was like "what do you mean homeless?" I said "he’s a vagrant living on the streets, he just needs a hand up" she was like "I don’t like it"...after that, the showering thing had come to an end. I mean, I could respect that... </p>

I got to meet so many people, I use to park off sometimes for longer than I should have at some people’s homes and of course, the women, I encountered and hooked-up with some very open-minded women along the way, it came with the territory and I didn’t mind... one day an old man called me, he introduced himself as fuad and continued to tell me his story. he was 65, a staunch muslim and had been diagnosed with cancer. on receiving the news, he embarked on a mission to prolong his life. he never smoked a day in his life. he read, researched, phoned, emailed and wanted me to organise him a bulk of cannabis that he could use to extract the essential ingredient and use the oils to treat his cancer. he died last year. there is a law that says this man is a criminal for pursuing a way to prolong his life. the law is unwavering, it doesn’t consider the exception; it can only enforce the rule. such a system is prone to health issues, as is any system that cannot adapt fast enough to supply the needs of its parts...</p>

		      <p> nothing will deaden the common sense of justice, nothing will separate humans so much from the general feeling of his time, as separation by class. when a human cannot sympathize with every kind of human then the state lacks oneness. the general feeling of the people is unexpressed because it has no common organ of expression and you obtain in laws not the living movement of the many but the dead traditions of the few

		      <p>love from the 021, this is msp FM 87.5... shout out to dark wing duck... the soundtrack to my life is stillness. a life where a vagrant sits calmly and enjoys a piece of dry bread against a graffiti plastered wall as the morning traffic zooms past him at 5 kilometers per hour. a life where another teenager falls pregnant without planning while wanting parents spend thousands trying to. a life where the cure for aids was part of a long term corporate growth strategy. a life where distraction is the major cause of destruction. a life were dispair and loneliness are a way of life for most. pretty bleak no?... the soundtrack to my life is blue skies, back-dropped by a spectacular forest mountain range, stretching toward a sandy beach and into the roaring waves of an inviting ocean, calling you to return to the water, to return to the earth, to none but all forever. ho$ dota</p>

		      <p>I know a man who has never left his country. inside these invisible borders he has learnt all the lessons life had chosen for him to bear witness to. if I showed you his heat signature on an interactive map, watched as a time-lapsed video over 70 years, played within the space of 5 minutes, you’ll notice that he hardly left the city within a 50km radius of where he lived. none the less, he lives a good life by any standard and is content with himself and tolerant of others. love is his fuel and his reward. distance traveled has little impact, on the broad variation in strokes love paints each unique living thing with. no matter how far you’ve come or still have to go, the love is always... right where you are</p>

		      <p>robben island had been granted world heritage status in 2076 and what had started as an experiment had morphed into a city. the island had become a self sustaining hive of energy, complete with everything any modern city could need, rethought on a revolutionary scale. it had grown 5 times its size in the space of 2 years. any human on the planet had been welcomed to live on the island for as short or as long a period as desired, the only fundamental requirement being community (or collaboration) in favour of cash (or commerce). there were boats, aircraft, submarines, cars, trucks and bicycles, sea and land farms, technology hubs, a global bluetooth network, a space center, everything a modern human family could need, and then.... twenty five years into the life of the island a young man, by re-purposing his family's entire wealth, single single-handedly enabled the large scale retrofitting of this self sustaining system across the planet.... it spread like wild fire, the fusion of mentality. a year after the wild fire, camps bay was reduced to a commune and overnight the face of cape town was transformed to become the biggest known free tourist destination, an alien concept to many humans.... but most who visited stayed. the island had by now become a well organised and well intentioned addiction.</p>
		      <br/>
		      <p>but that's just one way to think about it... I was speaking about this island story thingy to a friend the other night and  he told me that it was like a book he'd read, 'the venus project',  and another buddy said that da vinci also had a design for the perfect city, both authors providing practical guidelines on how to achieve this.... there are an infinite number of possibilities though, but how would you imagine it? i'd love to know.... there are many books written on this subject, and although its not revolutionary and there's not much harm in theory, in reality, it could be quite something, a beautiful something...</p>

		      <p>we’d been friends since I was 5 years old. we’d been in the same class and school for 12 years. he was hands down, the funniest guy ever, a potent raw humour, unmatched and never fully tapped. I watched as the love and then the laughter leave his being. I watched him plummet from courage to fear in a slow frame by frame movie, each second lasting a lifetime, and then slowed down even further as to seem as if time is standing still. I sit there and look at the slice of change to the now that is visible to me, and I feel as if I want to slide the ether right and regress his life to a point where he had all his hair and it was all messed up, full of grass, cheeks red of laughter and stomach muscles no longer able to cope with the none-stop-giggle-laugh he’d been having for the past almost hour now... the sun is burning his 12 year old skin, there is nothing right now that is bothering his mind. his face paints the picture to his thoughts, it is visible also just in his eyes. his life is the perfect answer to my childhood question on seeing the passed-out man on the pavement down the road from where we stayed, wanting to know "how does a person get like that... evens?"   ~ sometimes we go and chill on the beach, he’ll get in the car with a smile, fist pump me and then, almost immediately, break down in tears... <strong>heavy days bra</strong>... his thoughts now paints the look of regret, anger and hate on his face... he is my brother, and we are experiencing this one love together</p>

" says fiekie pointing to his hand "I also tell 8 bra... " <strong>"JUS"</strong> he replies "show me naaier" ... "there you can mos see" he argues... "vragtiewa this nai count 8, are you then jus to count 8?" he exclaims and immediately says "naaaaaaaai but wait naaier, how can we then both count 8?"  everybody checks their dumz, in hand and played, after a blazing-fast triple check the conclusion is as it stands, they both count 8... now... this is very interesting because a tell game is worth 2 points, but rarely if ever shared as a 1 point each sort of vibe and no where can be found a rule that says anything supporting or refuting this 1 point each system... everybody takes out their phones and google is jou naam brother.... after minutes of searching... nothing... there is no rule to govern such a situation in the entirety of the game of dominoes... the game is either won or not and points are never split, maybe if you got like 7 doubles or some kak like that it could prompt a reshuffle of the dumz but a replay of a game, very seldom... in all my whiskies I have never come across such a situation the score is 4 – 3... jakals being 1 point behind forced the game into a tell, but little did he anticipate <strong>this </strong> scenario and never before had it occurred... but jakals was never gonna versak on a potential win, he would rather vrek before he versak’d and plustins he couldn’t stand le tief... he’s pushing for a replay of their last game and they’re pushing for the logical and fair however unable to verify 1 point each rule system which would essentially give the boom to them, a poes trap in jakals’ eyes...  but with no one being able to confirm or deny the existence of such a rule it came down to the 4 players to decide how the wind should blow in favour of either 1. a replay or 2. a split point rule which would push jakals’ drol back into his hol... .but after some 4 way shouting jakals says rudely "have the vark boom man... druk it in your naat also... " "naaaaaaai, why must you be so" says le tief... ."hou jou bek still <strong>you</strong>... " says jakals eyeing her "<strong>naaier </strong>I will slut you in your poes" she says and picks up a knife lying on the small table to the left just above her head "I’ll cut off your vark trill and druk it in your bek... take me for a poes naaier" while waving the knife in the direction of his penis...  "you kak lucky your berk is here"...  le berk unmoved by this fleeting statement sits one way and calmly takes another sip of his beer, lifting and looking at his glass while savoring his mouthful... she immediately stands up and leans in to take a stab at jakals, and just just misses his hand... he hardly flinched, calmly turning away from her but still looking toward his friend, he makes his way toward his car keys on the table and says... "bra... your kin bra, please!"... ... and that was the end of that. there’s some tension now yes, but they’ll probz be playing another boom before the end of the weekend</p>

		      <p>politics was never spoken about at school, and if at home, not ever in her company. it sounded boring to her anyway, but there were little comments or subtle reminders like "don’t go there" and "stay away from... " stuff like that. she’s just a young beautiful woman, alive and loving life, she understood the psychology of oppression and did not subscribe to it, but also never having been out of the country, assumed it logical at the time that this oppression must be worldwide. the oppressor nomenclature was championed by those it benefited, and heard mostly, but seldom spoken by the oppressed she assumed... but after she finished college, became a teacher and raised a family, she started to unravel the gravity of the mentality... </p>

		      <p>he has the look of a man living on the street. his rent a mere 50 rand for the week, a wooden three by two sitting on the property of a woman who needs the extra two hundred per month. the details of his fall from positive bank balance is strewn over the course of 12 short years, owning many properties and businesses, looking great, smelling fresh and feeling on top of the world, a series of choices seemingly in his control leads him down the path to homelessness and then contemplative solitude. I ask him about his family, some live as close as the next suburb. he has grown children and loving parents. he says one day during labarang, that he saw his dad drive past the streets he walks everyday, jerome made as if he never saw. his dad paused the car, took a quick glance and then drove away slowly. jerome says "I think he just wanted to see me with his own eyes... " he chops and saws wood as part of the many odd jobs he takes on daily and is quite well built, when stripped down to his nakedness you will be surprised to find the physique&nbsp;of a swimmer, complete with 6 pack and killer thighs, he covers his body 24/7 with a one piece always-dirty overall. he wears dreads and making eye contact with him, will set off a smile on his face every time. he watches me living my life and I’m watching him living his. neither is good nor bad, neither is righter nor wronger. we are placed exactly where we need to be. the control most think there is in choice is the same lie believed by those who negate the fact that cells divide without your permission...  <a href="https://twitter.com/onequestionmany/status/553834953411026944" target="_blank">he leaves me with</a> "be grateful. you never need to say anything, we have forgotten how to speak without words" </p>

		      <p>2.4 kilometres in under 10 minutes reduces a squad of nearly 2000 hopefuls right down to a few hundred. the prelim before the test begins for all firefighters. clyde has been to trials for the past 5 years and makes it every year. his goal is to become a fire fighter. its all he can speak of and all he wants to do for the rest of his life. he gets moved around during the course of 5 years to all the fire stations in the 021 and eventually lands in roeland street...  things are looking up</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>on one of his off days, he decides to take a walk to the local rasta to get some bag weed, they sell it in five rand sections, wrapped in newspaper the size of about a swollen thumb...  on his way home the luck of the draw gets him searched by a patrol van and he’s taken in for "possession" of mostly stalks and seed. another sad day for our democracy. he spends the day in a holding cell and released the same night on one hundred rand bail. when he gets out, he feels like nothing but a warm shower and a hot plate. his weed craving has totally left him</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>the real sting comes when his record is pulled as part of the fire department’s due diligence. already having served 5 years with this charge, and after fighting numerous&nbsp;fires, working late shifts and giving a 150%, he is asked not to return to work for his contravention of the law, worth a meagre five rand, picked up after nearly five years in service as a seasonal fire fighter</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>the only way to clear his name is through a presidential pardon. our president, at his soul’s discretion can absolve this hard working fire fighter and restore him to his fire fighting glory. the thing that bugged me most is that less than half of our fire fighters will pass a blood test containing no trace of thc</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>he has made peace with it though. his life has moved on, but he will never be able to fight another fire in the 021...  and sitting opposite him on the see-saw of our legal system is a tiny little five rand section of bag weed. I seldom&nbsp;enjoy the thought of the few serving as the example to the many. while the many can grow, sell and smoke, the few serve as the reminder that there is a european law governing our african souls, one we take to heart, teach to our children and use as justification to enforce our will on others</p>

I wasn’t sure if he was hungry or really smaaking for some chocolate but his consideration during his breaking of the bread routine still had me captivated. none of those three knew each other. the driver after swallowing his last chew gives him a "shup bra" without taking his eyes off the road. the guy to his left with a still chocolatey mouth reaffirms the driver’s sentiment with an "aweh bra". he gets off at claremont and that was that. the driver never said a word to the other passenger all the way to wynberg. chocolate was shared and love was returned. the end</p>

		      <p>the young man who entered the blazing building and rescued the unconscious woman, must have been extremely brave! bravery then seems to be irrational, as going toward fire is not rational behaviour, based on this, it’s pretty safe to say that a suitable candidate for an antonym of phobia could easily be courage. if this be the case, why has courage not littered our language with more references to lean on? like the hundreds of suffixed phobias? why are there so little adequate variations to describe courage, as there are for fear?</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>a few over privileged, seemingly bored students at the university of the 021, have been misguided ever so slightly. when did the statue start bothering who? a false sense of entitlement seems to have had her way...  love might not have created or erected that statue, but it was <strong>definitely</strong> not love that tore it down, that attention seeking behaviour is the opposite of courage</p>

		      <p><strong>the most ancient of humans on earth are khoi.</strong> genetics trace their routes back millennia. around 50 000 years ago, various groups migrated out of southern africa, laying the genetic foundation for most of the modern world</p>

		      <p>cape town’s history is just another story unfolding. wikipedia cite "the arrival of the europeans" as the start of the history of the cape. the historical population tally somehow magically starts keeping check since 1658, with a total count of only 360 people</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>in the early 1500s a legendary khoi chief led a retaliation at the battle of salt river, the details vary. the khoi are non-violent, they do not attack at the site of ships, but those aristocratic portuguese must have had the fear of fuck in their eyes at the site of the khoi advancing, armed only with their fearlessness, enraged by those whose lives were taken so cheaply</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>the cultural genocide of the khoi did not start with our portuguese, dutch, german or english brothers, but at the hands of our bantu brethren, who have as much legitimate claim to the cape as the european cowboys...  smudging the very existence of khoi heritage with every law written. the very same khoi who’s DNA is imprinted on their soul’s fate</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>in the late 1700s another legendary khoi chief rebelled against the dispossession of traditional lands by an ordinance of the colonists, he was sent to robben island, escaped twice and was later shipped off to australia where he died...  and the rest as they say, is still being written</p>

		      <p><strong>now... </strong> who tries to hijack you in broad daylight, and then after chasing you down and forcing you into your driveway like a rabbit, stops dead in the middle of the road to tell you that you’re lucky – let me tell you something people, these guys are the real deal, soldiers, the true essence of what it means to be a "dala rot", their energy is real, their intentions clear and their courage unmatched...  this sort of fearlessness is not rare on the cape flats...  and after inquiring we had discovered that they were after the car, a silver vw polo, we escaped to tell the tale, but tonight, someone somewhere in cape town, driving a polo specifically, will feel their energy, just as we did, and those ones might not be as lucky... .</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>I really admire their fearlessness, when the driver spoke, I had no doubt that what was happening was the real deal, clearly ge’drug and more than likely ge’british...  today’s little escapade helped me to move closer to an understanding of a question that has been in mind for years now – "if it’s so easy to infect people with fear...  how can we infect people with love?" – something inside tells me, that those same two brothers, channeled toward the ends of one love, would strike love into the fear of any man’s heart... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>they are my brothers, and we are experiencing this one love together</p>

		      <p>her mother pimped her out when she was about thirteen, carving a permanent hole through her soul...  by 23 she had had four children from different fathers, she’s unable to know for sure who the various father’s are, such was the onslaught her body was exposed to...  her eldest daughter is expecting, but what exactly can she expect?</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>when I was kid, I remember she and her brother coming to our gate for food, she would never speak, but always smile, a beautiful young girl almost ready to be over powered by the will of ill-intentions. I never skimped on their requests either, some people like to get leftover foods, nah bra, I used the best food we ate to feed them, and with a non-existent father and mother who’s mind is not much focused on her children’s well-being let alone nutritional intake, her body never stood a chance and her mind followed suit... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>she passed me in the road yesterday, I barely recognized her, her face painted the picture of the visuals being replayed in her mind...  could you possibly imagine a kaleidoscope of her thoughts as a visual on your computer screen? can you imagine what her mentality looks like? I doubt she’ll see 50...  and no one will care</p>

		      <p>hey guys and welcome</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>remember in our last sesh, we spoke about being judgerag, the art of having your mentality held captive in a state of judgement, the actual word judge<strong>mental</strong> paints a very colourful picture of how your thoughts are being hijacked, in an effort to partake of a concept, experienced by no other living organism known to man...  judgement is like a programmable virus, that seems to have made its way out of god’s mind and into our fickle minds...  for those that don’t know, there are some humans that know what god is thinking, they form part of the billions, who like romeo and juliet, can fully understand the mind of their creator shakespeare, from whence they came</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>your brain is designed to have reflex like responses to how it has been programmed, if any question doesn’t immediately invoke a response and causes you to pause even for a second, the concept itself is not clearly defined in your mind, but more importantly, it fails the polarity test, it’s opposite is missing from your memory...  but why?</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>the following acid test has only two questions and should take the average human three seconds to answer each question respectively. <strong>good luck!</strong></p>
		      <br />
		      <p><strong>questions</strong></p>
		      <br />
		      <p>1. what is the opposite of hot, love and happy?</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>2. what is the opposite of business, judgement and self pity?</p>
		      <br />
		      <p><strong>conclusions</strong></p>
		      <br />
		      <p>question 1 should produce instant results based on your programming</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>question 2 should have most thinking for a few seconds, unsure, searching google for answers, asking a friend, but the knowledge of its counterpart is not instantly accessible to your programmable mind...  why is that?</p>
		      <br />
		      <p><strong>opposites inform...  </strong></p>
		      <br />
		      <p>well that’s it for today kids, don’t forget to be nice to the everybody and I’ll see you all again next time</p>

		      <p>"AWEH!!!!!...  AHOY!!!!!... .LOOOOIT!!!" he flags me down with arms and whistle about eight light poles back...  I turn around, its been a while since I’d seen marvin... .</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>if you saw him in the street, you periphery wouldn’t flag him for a full focused view, your perspective dismisses him out of hand, reassuring yourself silently...  "we all have choices in life" not knowing or trying to understand how he had been shaped to the point where he is today...  society shapes minds and is adept at numbing, sometimes killing the human spirit, if not equipped with a mentality that is strong enough to love... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>his shoes, pants and t-shirt barely holds the worn out threads together, he seems to wear clothes now only as a means to shade from the sun or cold or to cover up his parts...  he had walked about 35km from where he was staying to work in the garden of an old lady that he usually frequents, one of many on his pray roll...  but on arrival she sweetly told him "not today lovey...  I don’t have money now" and that was that...  he hadn’t eaten since the night before but was not really worried about food as he started to take his walk back home, not the most inviting space on earth...  he had been wearing a very strange cap, that had concealed the first few shaves of his hair, I asked him, what happened "she did turn off the electricity when I did want to cut my hair, sy’s deurie-nai, but o’right... "</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>he never knew his parents. he has a bed, not a room, with his aunt in hanover park...  his only contribution is a twenty toward electricity every friday, which he manages to skurrel quite easily. he’s addicted to heroine, known locally as unga, which costs him about thirty bucks for one revolution of the earth, he’s been to prison for "huis in braak" and has contemplated suicide most months for the last 15 years, he recalls once, sitting at princess vlei for the whole day, with a noose around his neck, sitting under the tree he had specifically chosen to use to snap his head from his spine...  but even in his drugged out state, he argues with himself...  telling himself "<strong>jy’s weak...  </strong>nai bra, jy’s fokken weak!... " eventually removing the noose, he wipes his tears and starts the 25km walk back to where the only bed he had available to him was waiting...  he learnt to sleep wherever he could feel safe enough to close his eyes without any harm coming to him, because we live on an earth, where a human is not allowed to put their head down anywhere and just close their eyes to rejuvenate the body and mind, sleep is no longer valued as a sacred thing...  those days are long gone</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>from that day onward the suicide attempts had come to a complete halt but the drug addiction remained...  armed only with a grade five qualification, his most credible employment was as a panel beating assistant to an old man in grassy park who had seen him grow up, giving him a hand up marvin swooped it up with open arms, it lasted a few months, he had stolen nothing more than a few tools, and was subsequently let go...  back into the wild</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>his mind is quite strong though, despite not having a strong human influence present throughout his life to guide him, he has had life herself as his teacher, a fact he is learning to be grateful for with every passing heartbeat, one day while walking, thinking about an old lady who gave him clothes and some food one day, and being in the area in which she lived, he nabs a cute little pot plant on his walk, with colourful pink petals to be used as a gift to the aunty that gave so generously, such is his want to give back, his intention supported by a means he is most accustomed to...  his intention be nothing but love though</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>this year he turns 26...  we always manage to find time to talk when our paths do cross, he never asks for sympathy but sometimes you’ll hear his mantra "... if you can help me with a two rand, I would appreciate it... " but he warns me, "... but you must ask with a smile bra...  you must mos work for it" smiling at me with no front teeth, penniless, but with enough love still to lead him back home to peace of mind...  </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>if you can’t get by with a little, you’re pretty fucked, because that’s all the love you’ll ever need</p>

		      <p>her brown skin was a map of softly wrinkled lines, each contour a lesson learnt...  grant gave her a moerse lot of headaches growing up, and was responsible for most of her grey hair, but he loved his taanie... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>one day he took a taxi to meet her at work because he really needed new takkies...  he left extra early to see mo, his getuie, on his way to squeeze in a quick bong for the day ahead...  arriving super early at his mom’s place of work, the minutes crawled toward the hour, even more so now that he was in his poes geroek, and plus he was feeling slightly paranoid too, as his thoughts dragged him from distraction to distraction... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>sitting on the edge of the opposite pavement and after waiting for almost 35 minutes outside mother’s building, he decided to do a little recce, he seldom comes to his mom’s work and even if he did he always waited outside...  but he needed new takkies and the shops closed at 5 and plus they didn’t have a car still...  he needed new takkies, it was urgent, the weekend was coming and he needed to look "fresh as fuck" for the kinnes mos... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>feeling bored he asks the security at the front desk if he could use the toilet, which was all the way on the other side of the building, which occupied almost an entire block in salt river’s industrial area...  the security guard, having been watching him all this time felt his pain and decided to let him through...  "molo bhuti, do you know the way?"... . to which he smiled "aweh... "</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>as he makes his way down the steel stairs and onto the ground floor landing, full of various types of machinery and prefabricated offices, he slowly makes his way to the other side of the factoryfloor, observing everyone and everything in his path, but being quite inconspicuous in his appearance and approach, no one paid him any mind, most of the staff were hard at focus, working on their whatevers...  </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>his mom had worked there for the 16 years of his life, plus another 12 more, and being stoned he was thinking this and other rather deep kak...  he hears a violent lashing of the tongue in the nearby distance, thinking to himself "that guy sounds pissed... " curious, he leans his walk toward the office, as he slowly passes he sees his mother standing in some guy’s office, speaking down to and scolding at her with the vilest adjectives, as he hammers her with protocol, process and politics, sprinkled with a healthy dose of cunt...  grant stands in full view of this motherfucker, looking him in the eye, hoping that he would put his head up and look his way...  but he didn’t, he was too lost in his own hate...  grant despised the way he spoke to his mother, it ate at his core, it enraged him...  his mother was reduced to tears, and the cunt swiftly asked her to get back to work and close the door behind her, with tears still streaming from her eyes... </p>
		      <br />
 		      <br />
		      <p>at that very same moment, while stirring her tea in the kitchen, their mother smiled out loud to herself, thinking about the two of them, and how they were the most precious things in the world to her...  from that day on grant’s behaviour toward his mother changed, his mother could never really understand what had suddenly happened to all his anger, he had somehow found a new channel in which to displace his energies, his anger was transmuted to purpose, his mother’s happiness was the only thing keeping him anchored...  although she attributes the changes in her son to her prayers being answered...  </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>it was on that day, replaying that scene in his mother’s poes boss’ office that he decided to change the world that his mother lived in...  he knew that changing the whole world was as easy as changing the thoughts in his own head, his mother was living proof – a small part of grant wanted to kill his mom’s boss, not in a figurative sort of way, he contemplated killing him for realsies...  but aweh</p>
