				<h1>behind closed doors</h1></br />
				<p>long ago, I worked as a developer for one of mzansi’s digital agencies, I did almost two years with them &amp; had amazing relations with everyone, even the haters loved me, but there was this one girl, who really wanted the “D”, she fuck flirted with me in private, away from the eyes of her peers, she let me know, in no uncertain terms, that she wanted it, but I gave her absolutely nothing, and her vagina couldn’t drum to that beat... she was my senior and as a result, could make my life at the office quite difficult, and that’s exactly what she did, she cornered me strategically with nothing but the flow of the workload, but aweh, I wasn’t phased, I’d been here before, then one day, shit turned to liquid and started splattering all over my work day, it had escalated to the point where she had used her “power”, to stall the flow of work for everyone as a way to get me to work double-time, and of course, she would have to be there too... but I was always ahead of her, I was tight with the designers, and so I asked one of them, “dood, how long does it take to finish a fucking template?”, and he was like “bra that shit was done yesterday and signed off!”, I was like “what the jas!”, I told him “send me those files, mail them to me now”, and he says “mrs bitch said I should only forward it to you in the morning”, to which I replied “naaier, send me that PSD now...” to which he replied with a smile, I go home, I kill the entire workload in a few hours and then intentionally arrive kak late to work the next day, I get a call from her senior, which is also her superficial facebook bestie, asking me ever so politely, “hey hugh, what time are you getting in, we got some urgent work that needs to be pushed out by 4”, I was like “hey you, oh that, no that’s done, ask hartseer-hond to check her inbox” *obviously I used her name, when I get into the office, I feel the heat &amp; beats from both of their pussies, they were so caught off-guard that I had done the work, they had no words, it was beautiful to see them stumble over their own misguided intentions, that’s when I had it out with her senior and then spoke to our head honcho in HR, I told them “guys, she’s putting the client at risk, to play out her little fantasies...”, two days later, I’m charged with sexual harassment and no less than four, of the other female staff had taken a stand against me, using misconstrued emails, to enforce whatever direction it is their will had intentioned, but aweh, you have to pick your battles mos, so I take my two months paid vacation, spent loads of time at the beach, and then got back onto my bike... </br /></br />

				<h1>a story of love</h1></br />
				<p>a few years ago I met a really nice girl... we clicked &amp; the sex was next level, the energy transfer between us was almost effortless, even the way we argued about simple things felt familiar, as if we’d done it before, but for sure the feeling was not foreign to me, it felt like a home I remembered from a when I can’t recall...<br/><br/>
					we made a pact, we saw each other in secret mostly and we lead seemingly single lives, we were focused on our individualities, we never lived together, sleepovers of course, even weekends, but very discreetly, our connection was not common knowledge and so remained untainted by anything other that what we ourselves tainted it with... but neither of us did any tainting of any kind, we agreed to always lift each other up, or let each other go, this is true love as far as we could see... <br/><br/>

					all I cared about was seeing her flourish and flower into the beauty that she already was, it was like a secret, but a beautiful one, and we cherished it more than any tangible thing in our lives... we developed a bond that is without distance or time, we truly became one, just being ourselves<br/><br/>

						most of them<br/>

						because although you see them on the street<br/>
						she has a bed<br/>
						and a place she calls home<br/>
						and some people that love her<br/>
						and that hug her<br/>
						and care for her<br/>
						without judging her<br/><br/>

						a few months ago, I felt like a nsa quickie<br/>
						and instead of reaching for my contacts<br/>
						I thought I’m going to take a drive<br/>
						for old times sake<br/>
						I mission toward a spot<br/>
						I see a nice young lady<br/>
						she hops in<br/>
						we’re off to mine<br/>
						but its like twenty mins to get to my place<br/>
						so I chat to her<br/>
						and we become acquainted <br/>
						she spends the night and I ask her if she wants to come back the following weekend<br/>
						she says yes<br/>
						but never arrived<br/><br/>

						a good few months later<br/>
						I’m looking for another nsa quickie<br/>

						and then I spot the same chick<br/>
						at a different spot<br/>
						but on my route<br/>
						I flash her down<br/>
						and she recognises me immediately<br/>
						she smiles and gets in<br/>
						she says<br/>
						"yor, do you know how I was trying to find your place, I walked up and down for hours but I couldn’t remember where to go..."<br/>
						I smiled and said<br/>
						"you mos gonna see now..."<br/>
						she laughs and says<br/>
						"yorrr..."<br/>
						she spends the night<br/><br/>

						two days later <br/>
						she arrives at my home<br/>
						shouting at the gate<br/>
						I go out to open for her and to see what she wants<br/>
						she has a tray of fresh hannepoot grapes<br/>
						she says "I did bring you grapes…" and smiles<br/>
						I’m like "thanks that’s really nice, but what’s wrong, is everything okay?"<br/>
						she says "yes everything’s okay, I just wanted to see you..."<br/>
						and I say "but I’m working right now" and I invite her in for some juice<br/>
						because it seems she’s been walking for a while<br/>
						when we get inside I tell her<br/>
						"I don’t have money and you can’t just stiek uit like this when you want to"<br/>
						she smiles and says "I’m sorry I just wanted to see you..."
						and then I asked her "but why, what’s up, tell me..."<br/>
						she can’t get it out<br/>
						she says "I want the D"<br/>
						I smile and say "I don’t have money sister..."<br/>
						she says ever so seriously with a hint of seduction "I don’t want money..."<br/>
						I smiled and said "that’s a first for me..."<br/><br/>

						so I said "just give me five minutes<br/>
						and I’ll sort you out, but then you must go kanala, I really need to work..."<br/>
						after a few hours, she leaves and I tell her<br/>
						"you can’t just stiek uit like this… if you want you can pick a day and we can connect then"<br/>
						I say "what day..."<br/>
						she says "friday..."<br/>
						and she’s been coming here like clockwork for the past few months now<br/>
						she’s never since asked me for money or anything<br/>
						she asks for nothing...<br/>
						and because of that<br/>
						I make her tea<br/>
						I run her bath<br/>
						and I massage her feet...<br/>

I flirt with her, she don’t mind, and her initially car-idling haste is veered of course as I dish her some of my bestest mating behaviour, she turns off the ignition and reaches for her cigarettes without taking her eyes off the conversation – I now had an audience – but I ask her only what I need to know, under the cover of the wooing. ten minutes past, I end the conversation and exit the car swiftly. the night was just getting started... </p>

		      <br />
		      <p>wayne came to cape town from the eastern cape looking for work, money, gold and gifts to take back home to his family, he thought in a few years he’d be leaving cape town with a drop top bmw, a boot full of cash and a jus pair of shades, but the reality he was finding to be much harsher than what he’d expected. the skurrel life is taxing on the soul and the body takes a good few knocks along the way.</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>I watched a young lady shave 10-15 years off her life just by living and sleeping on the street for only 3 years, no warm slippers to push your feet into as you drag them and your half closed eyes to your underfloor heated bathroom with heated toilet seat and double ply toilet paper, but aweh, nobody’s pointing fingers, somebody is just writing words and another person is reading them.</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>so I invite wayne over to my place, not to work but to come chill. I give him my address and tell him that if he can make it to my place anytime saturday morning I’d put together a cv for him, print off like a million copies and try to fire his drive...  we had some beers, i made us a jus lunch, we smoked a spliff and all the while trying not to "inspire" him but to "connect" with him, I told him that if he wanted he could work in the garden every saturday for some extra cash and after about 2 months of that, a friend arranged a space for him in his furniture factory in maitland... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>four months later my buddy calls me saying "kyk hieso, this bra is catching on kak" no-show monday’s, awol-friday’s and drunken master nommers for the rest of the week, but aweh, what could I say, I told my buddy to treat him fairly and obviously he had to let him go, so back to ground zero wayne goes and again is without work for another 7 months this time...  its tough bra, no family to lean on, no real friends, no moral support, man alone...  pretty much</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>he eventually shows up back at my place, saying that he fucked up and that he really needed a job...  its like taking back a cheating husband, you wanna believe the nai, but you mos know – I wys him not to worry and don’t make him feel worse than he already does, I give him better options this time, instead of hand-delivering his fate to him with a number to call – this time he needed to push the stone himself – and push he did, his girlfriend was now pregnant with his second child. he lives in masiphumelele with a friend and she in langa with her mother, the kids are fucking beautiful...  she doesn’t work and at the moment neither does he, but somehow it works</p>

I’m on my way to the third aunty in a one kilometer radius that’s making koesiesters this morning, outside her home is a young man, who seems to have arrived directly from his saturday evening, leaning against the low fence of the aunty’s home, stuffing koesiesters into his mouth, gazing into the sunday morning distance, I approach him slowly, with a smile and hit him with "... for most mense in cape town, sunday sieker tastes like koesiesters nuh?" he chews, nods, smiles, swallows and then says "aweh, light us a entjie and then we continue this conversation...

		      <br />
		      <p>and after we kill the boer and restore all his injustices, we must travel further into the past to make sure our endeavors are not narrow-minded attempts at feeding our fickle fantasies of transgressions within reach of our grandmother’s eyes...  no...  we must fight a bigger fight than that, one that goes back to transgressions against all humans that have gone before us, billions upon billions of minds and heartbeats, who lay as ashes, forgotten, but only for those who see with eyes alone...  if rhodes must fall, so too must the entire building and erf that is uct, because it was his money that built much of the university, and after the uct erf is flattened, you must flatten rhodes memorial, you must kill his family, the businesses, roads and clinics he built, you must kill all the books he wrote and you must kill his spirit, and when you’re done, without realising that you have killed a piece of yourself, will you feel more alive then, will your reward be just, or will you be just like him, only standing on the other side of your own mirror, looking at him, but seeing yourself...  education should be free, but we should maybe reestablish what exactly education is before we light the fuse... </p>

		      <br />
		      <p>with homes in every province in most countries around the world and privy to a transport network few humans know exist, their new-age technology pales in comparison only to the mastery of their telepathic and kinetic abilities...  their opulent lifestyle surpasses the superficiality of mere brands and as each new-born enters into their world, a planet is gifted to them, ownership transferred by the authority of the gift giver’s will alone...  the real estate game has long since moved off the face of earth into the furthest reaches of our milky way</p>

		      <p>the families never fraternize with the general population, ever, and steer clear of any main stream anything, they are not off the grid as it were, they are beyond the reach of the grid...  this is not a social event, this is a family affair and their opulence has afforded them a view of the planet that leaves no room for day time distractions of any kind...  there is much to conquer</p>

		      <p>chaperons have a lineage treasured and valued as highly as any member of the line. Sara is an exquisite human being, she speaks hundreds of languages fluently, including signing, which she used often as a child with her siblings...  she is skilled across vast philosophies and numerous disciplines...  a chaperon is chosen and gifted as the right hand to every living member of the entire family, it is a life-long bond, a protector of equal caliber, ready to die for the longevity of the line</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>Ojila, is the eighth daughter of Kiel, a six year gap exists between a shaper and line child, an ancient birth rhythm is kept in sync by chaperon families all over the world, there are multiple chaperons to choose from for any one blood child birthed. Sara is the only chaperon to ever be chosen at five years of age because of her undeniable brilliance in all manner of adaptation... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>Poghi is chaperon to Kiel’s wife Oni, she is also Sara’s mom and can outlast anything thrown at her. while growing up Sara’s mom would intercept her thoughts midstream and then say out calmly, "... sara, stop messing with your thoughts... " – it scared her that her mom could see inside her head like that, she remembered being excited at the prospect of being able to do such things to other people one day... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>while a few million humans on earth collectively mourn the death of a super star, Sara and Ojila prepare to leave for the south of the planet and then onto a submarine hike of the trenches close to saint helena...  one of their probes had recently discovered a new cavity just below the crust, closer to the old south end, that leads to a water filled well of unearthly beauty, unlike anything they’d both ever seen before, pure and perfect drinking water almost as old as the earth herself, this would be their second visit but first excavation...  their excitement was in sync</p>

		      <p>when I married this trend had escalated to allowing vagrants to use my home as a pit stop, a shower, shave, and a hot meal with a take-away and whatever else I could help them with. one day one of the guys I was helping had not had a hot shower in so long, he used all the hot water in the geyser, soaking up every last hot drop, the bathroom wreaked of his scent and that’s how she found out. she was like "did somebody take a shower here today?" I was getting sloppy, not cleaning up my tracks like I use to. I couldn’t worm my way out of this one, she was on to me. I told her "yes, he’s a friend I’m trying to help, he’s just going through a bad patch" she says "but where does he live, why does he need to shower here?" quite a reasonable question I thought and I was like "he’s homeless" she was like "what do you mean homeless?" I said "he’s a vagrant living on the streets, he just needs a hand up" she was like "I don’t like it"...after that, the showering thing had come to an end. I mean, I could respect that... </p>

		      <p>robben island had been granted world heritage status in 2076 and what had started as an experiment had morphed into a city. the island had become a self sustaining hive of energy, complete with everything any modern city could need, rethought on a revolutionary scale. it had grown 5 times its size in the space of 2 years. any human on the planet had been welcomed to live on the island for as short or as long a period as desired, the only fundamental requirement being community (or collaboration) in favour of cash (or commerce). there were boats, aircraft, submarines, cars, trucks and bicycles, sea and land farms, technology hubs, a global bluetooth network, a space center, everything a modern human family could need, and then.... twenty five years into the life of the island a young man, by re-purposing his family's entire wealth, single single-handedly enabled the large scale retrofitting of this self sustaining system across the planet.... it spread like wild fire, the fusion of mentality. a year after the wild fire, camps bay was reduced to a commune and overnight the face of cape town was transformed to become the biggest known free tourist destination, an alien concept to many humans.... but most who visited stayed. the island had by now become a well organised and well intentioned addiction.</p>

I watched as the love and then the laughter leave his being. I watched him plummet from courage to fear in a slow frame by frame movie, each second lasting a lifetime, and then slowed down even further as to seem as if time is standing still. I sit there and look at the slice of change to the now that is visible to me, and I feel as if I want to slide the ether right and regress his life to a point where he had all his hair and it was all messed up, full of grass, cheeks red of laughter and stomach muscles no longer able to cope with the none-stop-giggle-laugh he’d been having for the past almost hour now... the sun is burning his 12 year old skin, there is <strong>nothing </strong>right now that is bothering his mind. his face paints the picture to his thoughts, it is visible also just in his eyes. his life is the perfect answer to my childhood question on seeing the passed-out man on the pavement down the road from where we stayed, wanting to know "how does a person get like that... evens?"   ~ sometimes we go and chill on the beach, he’ll get in the car with a smile, fist pump me and then, almost immediately, break down in tears... <strong>heavy days bra</strong>... his thoughts now paints the look of regret, anger and hate on his face... </p>

" says fiekie pointing to his hand "I also tell 8 bra... " <strong>"JUS"</strong> he replies "show me naaier" ... "there you can mos see" he argues... "vragtiewa this nai count 8, are you then jus to count 8?" he exclaims and immediately says "naaaaaaaai but wait naaier, how can we then both count 8?"  everybody checks their dumz, in hand and played, after a blazing-fast triple check the conclusion is as it stands, they both count 8... now... this is very interesting because a tell game is worth 2 points, but rarely if ever shared as a 1 point each sort of vibe and no where can be found a rule that says anything supporting or refuting this 1 point each system... everybody takes out their phones and google is jou naam brother.... after minutes of searching... nothing... there is no rule to govern such a situation in the entirety of the game of dominoes... the game is either won or not and points are never split, maybe if you got like 7 doubles or some kak like that it could prompt a reshuffle of the dumz but a replay of a game, very seldom... in all my whiskies I have never come across such a situation the score is 4 – 3... jakals being 1 point behind forced the game into a tell, but little did he anticipate <strong>this </strong>scenario and never before had it occurred... but jakals was never gonna versak on a potential win, he would rather vrek before he versak’d and plustins he couldn’t stand le tief... he’s pushing for a replay of their last game and they’re pushing for the logical and fair however unable to verify 1 point each rule system which would essentially give the boom to them, a poes trap in jakals’ eyes...  but with no one being able to confirm or deny the existence of such a rule it came down to the 4 players to decide how the wind should blow in favour of either 1. a replay or 2. a split point rule which would push jakals’ drol back into his hol... .but after some 4 way shouting jakals says rudely "have the vark boom man... druk it in your naat also... " "naaaaaaai, why must you be so" says le tief... ."hou jou bek still <strong>you</strong>... " says jakals eyeing her "<strong>naaier </strong>I will slut you in your poes" she says and picks up a knife lying on the small table to the left just above her head "I’ll cut off your vark trill and druk it in your bek... take me for a poes naaier" while waving the knife in the direction of his penis...  "you kak lucky your berk is here"...  le berk unmoved by this fleeting statement sits one way and calmly takes another sip of his beer, lifting and looking at his glass while savoring his mouthful... she immediately stands up and leans in to take a stab at jakals, and just just misses his hand... he hardly flinched, calmly turning away from her but still looking toward his friend, he makes his way toward his car keys on the table and says... "bra... your kin bra, please!"... ... and that was the end of that. there’s some tension now yes, but they’ll probz be playing another boom before the end of the weekend</p>
		      <br />
		      <p style="text-transform:uppercase;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;">in the event of an unlikely tell draw and with no 1 point each rule verbally agreed upon before playing and with no long standing rule in place to lean on, the game should be forced into a replay under the say-ma-so code of reason, the code we all fall back onto, in times of disagreement</p>

I ask him about his family, some live as close as the next suburb. he has grown children and loving parents. he says one day during labarang, that he saw his dad drive past the streets he walks everyday, jerome made as if he never saw. his dad paused the car, took a quick glance and then drove away slowly. jerome says "I think he just wanted to see me with his own eyes... " he chops and saws wood as part of the many odd jobs he takes on daily and is quite well built, when stripped down to his nakedness you will be surprised to find the physique&nbsp;of a swimmer, complete with 6 pack and killer thighs, he covers his body 24/7 with a one piece always-dirty overall. he wears dreads and making eye contact with him, will set off a smile on his face every time. he watches me living my life and I’m watching him living his. neither is good nor bad, neither is righter nor wronger. we are placed exactly where we need to be. the control most think there is in choice is the same lie believed by those who negate the fact that cells divide without your permission...  <a href="https://twitter.com/onequestionmany/status/553834953411026944" target="_blank">he leaves me with</a> "be grateful. you never need to say anything, we have forgotten how to speak without words" </p>

		      <p>on one of his off days, he decides to take a walk to the local rasta to get some bag weed, they sell it in five rand sections, wrapped in newspaper the size of about a swollen thumb...  on his way home the luck of the draw gets him searched by a patrol van and he’s taken in for "possession" of mostly stalks and seed. another sad day for our democracy. he spends the day in a holding cell and released the same night on one hundred rand bail. when he gets out, he feels like nothing but a warm shower and a hot plate. his weed craving has totally left him</p>

		      <p>the real sting comes when his record is pulled as part of the fire department’s due diligence. already having served 5 years with this charge, and after fighting numerous&nbsp;fires, working late shifts and giving a 150%, he is asked not to return to work for his contravention of the law, worth a meagre five rand, picked up after nearly five years in service as a seasonal fire fighter</p>

		      <p>the only way to clear his name is through a presidential pardon. our president, at his soul’s discretion can absolve this hard working fire fighter and restore him to his fire fighting glory. the thing that bugged me most is that less than half of our fire fighters will pass a blood test containing no trace of thc</p>

		      <p>he has made peace with it though. his life has moved on, but he will never be able to fight another fire in the 021...  and sitting opposite him on the see-saw of our legal system is a tiny little five rand section of bag weed. I seldom&nbsp;enjoy the thought of the few serving as the example to the many. while the many can grow, sell and smoke, the few serve as the reminder that there is a european law governing our african souls, one we take to heart, teach to our children and use as justification to enforce our will on others</p>

I wasn’t sure if he was hungry or really smaaking for some chocolate but his consideration during his breaking of the bread routine still had me captivated. none of those three knew each other. the driver after swallowing his last chew gives him a "shup bra" without taking his eyes off the road. the guy to his left with a still chocolatey mouth reaffirms the driver’s sentiment with an "aweh bra". he gets off at claremont and that was that. the driver never said a word to the other passenger all the way to wynberg. chocolate was shared and love was returned. the end</p>

		      <p>the young man who entered the blazing building and rescued the unconscious woman, must have been extremely brave! bravery then seems to be irrational, as going toward fire is not rational behaviour, based on this, it’s pretty safe to say that a suitable candidate for an antonym of phobia could easily be courage. if this be the case, why has courage not littered our language with more references to lean on? like the hundreds of suffixed phobias? why are there so little adequate variations to describe courage, as there are for fear?</p>

		      <p>a few over privileged, seemingly bored students at the university of the 021, have been misguided ever so slightly. when did the statue start bothering who? a false sense of entitlement seems to have had her way...  love might not have created or erected that statue, but it was <strong>definitely</strong> not love that tore it down, that attention seeking behaviour is the opposite of courage</p>

		      <br />
		      <p>in the early 1500s a legendary khoi chief led a retaliation at the battle of salt river, the details vary. the khoi are non-violent, they do not attack at the site of ships, but those aristocratic portuguese must have had the fear of fuck in their eyes at the site of the khoi advancing, armed only with their fearlessness, enraged by those whose lives were taken so cheaply</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>the cultural genocide of the khoi did not start with our portuguese, dutch, german or english brothers, but at the hands of our bantu brethren, who have as much legitimate claim to the cape as the european cowboys...  smudging the very existence of khoi heritage with every law written. the very same khoi who’s DNA is imprinted on their soul’s fate</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>in the late 1700s another legendary khoi chief rebelled against the dispossession of traditional lands by an ordinance of the colonists, he was sent to robben island, escaped twice and was later shipped off to australia where he died...  and the rest as they say, is still being written</p>

		      <br />
		      <p>that is kak interesting actually, I mean, if I think about it, hot and cold, love and hate, east and west...  but business and ? </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>no no no hold your horses just there hugh, its not always that black and white, what is the opposite of arm for example, or the opposite of hat, our "in the opposites" research points to many anomalies like these, for example what is the opposite of [your word here] and if you cannot find an opposite within the split of a second, you should maybe ask why? or where? where is this little buddy’s buddy, where is his or her opposite? </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>fascinating! so tell us professor, are we any closer to discovering this illusive opposite to this mammoth known as "business"? </p>

		      <p>yes and no, yes we are close to discovering the opposite but not in the way that its understood</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>sorry professor I don’t follow..</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>sure, you see hugh, business is not a tangible thing? yes it has buildings and machines and labour etc but it, in itself, is a ghost, an apparition that exists in a shared mindset, diluted onto paper, printing narrow-minded references to moments of nothingness – does that help hugh?</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>that’s a bit much, I was looking for a more simpler something for our listeners to latch onto, like a catchy rhyme or some lyrical lexicon maybe?</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>sure, okay then hugh, think about it like this...  <strong>the lack of an opposite, points the way to a why</strong></p>
		      <br />
		      <p>Ahhh, I see!</p>

		         people expect to hear these per second insights wherever they turn, people "expect" a lot from these little stories for example, they want to be entertained...  "expectations" are on an all time high, the misinformed and uninformed are now uniformed...  this disease of expectation is a beautiful creation of self distraction, a benchmark with which to judge the entire universe, with little understanding of something as fundamental as what electricity is, how to explain it to another human, or how to harness it, to store it, the ability to do without throwing paper at it, basic human knowledge, forgone, for why though? for some entertainment?

		      <p>in their eight years together, this had been the worst, but drowning out the sound of his shouting, while slipping on her flip-flops, grabbing her cigarettes and lighter with one swift swoop, not even bothering to look in the mirror, taking a key or caring what she had on, she calmly walked out the door... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>the busy main road they lived close to was reduced to a few cars every now and then, but the night could do nothing to shift her focus, she was so upset, she had crossed over into calm...  not even realising that she had walked 5 kilometers, she reached for another cigarette, to light it from the one she’d just finished and was about to kill... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>she had the walk and look of someone who was going no-where...  a silver toyota sedan pulled up beside her, he remotes down the passenger window and leans in to ask "... are you working?" at first it didn’t click, but in her calm state she gave nothing away to him on her face "... werk jy?" he asks again to make sure and then she says "yes...  I’m working... ." <strong>totally out of character</strong> and as if it was her hundredth time, she got into the car, closed the door, took in some of her cigarette and exhaled while thinking "... what a poes!!" her mind still at home in their lounge, but her pussy, being fiddled with by the driver’s right hand... she opens her legs and leans her head back and after a few light poles down a dingy side road he says "... let’s park there... "</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>he pays her, not knowing or caring to know anything else about her, he drops her off as quickly as he came...  then she lit another cigarette and started making her way back, she came home to an unlocked front-door and a husband asleep on the couch with the playstation on pause, she locks the door behind her, switches off the tv and speakers, snuggles in behind "the poes that he was" and falls asleep... </p>

		      </br />
		      <p>daylight audacity, like something out of a reality...  we’re about to make a calm right turn at a four way intersection, an undercover police vehicle pulls into our side, 45 degrees into the turn, the driver speaks to denny through the passenger window, its 6:14pm in the evening, light as day, his car is blocking the paused vehicle to his right, who is now unable to turn left...  the aggression of the driver and his passenger could be felt through the car...  the two occupants look nothing like police officers, they have the look of death in their eyes...  both in full recognizable view, I will never forget their faces...  denny’s two year old daughter is strapped into the front seat, I’m at the back and was about to be dropped off after a quick trip to the shop. the driver in the white chevrolet shouts out "bly jy hier...  do you live here, waar bly jy.. bly jy hier?" and revs and edges his car into our way, barely touching us, his intent was clear...  denny floors the car, we start flying down the avenue, he pauses at the approaching four way in his mind and races over it without stopping, all the while picking up speed, he gets to the top of the avenue and is about 1km from his home, he makes a sharp right and then a hard left...  home straight, these guys are not fucking around, they come about his right side but are forced to duck behind us because of the narrow road and on-coming cars...  we fly over another fourway, this time, forcing the driver on the left to brake really hard...  I unstrap mia from the front seat and bring her toward me, she thinks its a game, these fukkers have no value for human life, all we care about is getting her out of harm’s way...  we’re fast approaching denny’s drive-way, they slow down after we’d pulled in and stop about ten houses down...  he pulls the car all the way down into the driveway and then without looking and before getting out says "take mia inside... " and heads toward the gate, he calls over the neighbour’s son and stands in front of their house, looking down into the street at the car that was just chasing us, the car is paused, after a few second talk with some locals, a third passenger gets into the back and their car slowly drives toward denny’s house, by that time, denny and three locals, one on a bmx, where hovered in front of his driveway and the gate closed behind him...  the car rolls up slowly, stops in front of the house and the middle of the road, the passenger calmly gets out and points at denny "virdag is jou fokking lucky dag brudder... " the driver paints the portrait of death with his stare, the mystery guest in the backseat is the son of an important someone, he, knowing denny from "the area", eases their minds with his rank and reassures him that denny is not a threat and in fact a "friendly" – before taking off the driver looks at denny and says slowy <strong>"jy’s fokking lucky... "</strong> and slowly, very  very slowly pulls away... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p><strong>now... </strong> who tries to hijack you in broad daylight, and then after chasing you down and forcing you into your driveway like a rabbit, stops dead in the middle of the road to tell you that you’re lucky – let me tell you something people, these guys are the real deal, soldiers, the true essence of what it means to be a "dala rot", their energy is real, their intentions clear and their courage unmatched...  this sort of fearlessness is not rare on the cape flats...  and after inquiring we had discovered that they were after the car, a silver vw polo, we escaped to tell the tale, but tonight, someone somewhere in cape town, driving a polo specifically, will feel their energy, just as we did, and those ones might not be as lucky... .</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>I really admire their fearlessness, when the driver spoke, I had no doubt that what was happening was the real deal, clearly ge’drug and more than likely ge’british...  today’s little escapade helped me to move closer to an understanding of a question that has been in mind for years now – "if it’s so easy to infect people with fear...  how can we infect people with love?" – something inside tells me, that those same two brothers, channeled toward the ends of one love, would strike love into the fear of any man’s heart... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>they are my brothers, and we are experiencing this one love together</p>

		      <p>when I was kid, I remember she and her brother coming to our gate for food, she would never speak, but always smile, a beautiful young girl almost ready to be over powered by the will of ill-intentions.

		      <p>hey guys and welcome</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>remember in our last sesh, we spoke about being judgerag, the art of having your mentality held captive in a state of judgement, the actual word judge<strong>mental</strong> paints a very colourful picture of how your thoughts are being hijacked, in an effort to partake of a concept, experienced by no other living organism known to man...  judgement is like a programmable virus, that seems to have made its way out of god’s mind and into our fickle minds...  for those that don’t know, there are some humans that know what god is thinking, they form part of the billions, who like romeo and juliet, can fully understand the mind of their creator shakespeare, from whence they came</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>your brain is designed to have reflex like responses to how it has been programmed, if any question doesn’t immediately invoke a response and causes you to pause even for a second, the concept itself is not clearly defined in your mind, but more importantly, it fails the polarity test, it’s opposite is missing from your memory...  but why?</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>the following acid test has only two questions and should take the average human three seconds to answer each question respectively. <strong>good luck!</strong></p>
		      <br />
		      <p><strong>questions</strong></p>
		      <br />
		      <p>1. what is the opposite of hot, love and happy?</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>2. what is the opposite of business, judgement and self pity?</p>
		      <br />
		      <p><strong>conclusions</strong></p>
		      <br />
		      <p>question 1 should produce instant results based on your programming</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>question 2 should have most thinking for a few seconds, unsure, searching google for answers, asking a friend, but the knowledge of its counterpart is not instantly accessible to your programmable mind...  why is that?</p>

		      <p>"AWEH!!!!!...  AHOY!!!!!... .LOOOOIT!!!" he flags me down with arms and whistle about eight light poles back...  I turn around, its been a while since I’d seen marvin... .</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>if you saw him in the street, you periphery wouldn’t flag him for a full focused view, your perspective dismisses him out of hand, reassuring yourself silently...  "we all have choices in life" not knowing or trying to understand how he had been shaped to the point where he is today...  society shapes minds and is adept at numbing, sometimes killing the human spirit, if not equipped with a mentality that is strong enough to love... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>his shoes, pants and t-shirt barely holds the worn out threads together, he seems to wear clothes now only as a means to shade from the sun or cold or to cover up his parts...  he had walked about 35km from where he was staying to work in the garden of an old lady that he usually frequents, on of many on his pray roll...  but on arrival she sweetly told him "not today lovey...  I don’t have money now" and that was that...  he hadn’t eaten since the night before but was not really worried about food as he started to take his walk back home, not the most inviting space on earth...  he had been wearing a very strange cap, that had concealed the first few shaves of his hair, I asked him, what happened "she did turn off the electricity when I did want to cut my hair, sy’s deurie-nai, but o’right... "</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>he never knew his parents. he has a bed, not a room, with his aunt in hanover park...  his only contribution is a twenty toward electricity every friday, which he manages to skurrel quite easily. he’s addicted to heroine, known locally as unga, which costs him about thirty bucks for one revolution of the earth, he’s been to prison for "huis in braak" and has contemplated suicide most months for the last 15 years, he recalls once, sitting at princess vlei for the whole day, with a noose around his neck, sitting under the tree he had specifically chosen to use to snap his head from his spine...  but even in his drugged out state, he argues with himself...  telling himself "<strong>jy’s weak...  </strong>nai bra, jy’s fokken weak!... " eventually removing the noose, he wipes his tears and starts the 25km walk back to where the only bed he had available to him was waiting...  he learnt to sleep wherever he could feel safe enough to close his eyes without any harm coming to him, because we live on an earth, where a human is not allowed to put their head down anywhere and just close their eyes to rejuvenate the body and mind, sleep is no longer valued as a sacred thing...  those days are long gone</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>from that day onward the suicide attempts had come to a complete halt but the drug addiction remained...  armed only with a grade five qualification, his most credible employment was as a panel beating assistant to an old man in grassy park who had seen him grow up, giving him a hand up marvin swooped it up with open arms, it lasted a few months, he had stolen nothing more than a few tools, and was subsequently let go...  back into the wild</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>his mind is quite strong though, despite not having a strong human influence present throughout his life to guide him, he has had life herself as his teacher, a fact he is learning to be grateful for with every passing heartbeat, one day while walking, thinking about an old lady who gave him clothes and some food one day, and being in the area in which she lived, he nabs a cute little pot plant on his walk, with colourful pink petals to be used as a gift to the aunty that gave so generously, such is his want to give back, his intention supported by a means he is most accustomed to...  his intention be nothing but love though</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>this year he turns 26...  we always manage to find time to talk when our paths do cross, he never asks for sympathy but sometimes you’ll hear his mantra "... if you can help me with a two rand, I would appreciate it... " but he warns me, "... but you must ask with a smile bra...  you must mos work for it" smiling at me with no front teeth, penniless, but with enough love still to lead him back home to peace of mind...  </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>if you can’t get by with a little, you’re pretty fucked, because that’s all the love you’ll ever need</p>

		      <br />
		      <p>one day he took a taxi to meet her at work because he really needed new takkies...  he left extra early to see mo, his getuie, on his way to squeeze in a quick bong for the day ahead...  arriving super early at his mom’s place of work, the minutes crawled toward the hour, even more so now that he was in his poes geroek, and plus he was feeling slightly paranoid too, as his thoughts dragged him from distraction to distraction... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>sitting on the edge of the opposite pavement and after waiting for almost 35 minutes outside mother’s building, he decided to do a little recce, he seldom comes to his mom’s work and even if he did he always waited outside...  but he needed new takkies and the shops closed at 5 and plus they didn’t have a car still...  he needed new takkies, it was urgent, the weekend was coming and he needed to look "fresh as fuck" for the kinnes mos... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>feeling bored he asks the security at the front desk if he could use the toilet, which was all the way on the other side of the building, which occupied almost an entire block in salt river’s industrial area...  the security guard, having been watching him all this time felt his pain and decided to let him through...  "molo bhuti, do you know the way?"... . to which he smiled "aweh... "</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>as he makes his way down the steel stairs and onto the ground floor landing, full of various types of machinery and prefabricated offices, he slowly makes his way to the other side of the factoryfloor, observing everyone and everything in his path, but being quite inconspicuous in his appearance and approach, no one paid him any mind, most of the staff were hard at focus, working on their whatevers...  </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>his mom had worked there for the 16 years of his life, plus another 12 more, and being stoned he was thinking this and other rather deep kak...  he hears a violent lashing of the tongue in the nearby distance, thinking to himself "that guy sounds pissed... " curious, he leans his walk toward the office, as he slowly passes he sees his mother standing in some guy’s office, speaking down to and scolding at her with the vilest adjectives, as he hammers her with protocol, process and politics, sprinkled with a healthy dose of cunt...  grant stands in full view of this motherfucker, looking him in the eye, hoping that he would put his head up and look his way...  but he didn’t, he was too lost in his own hate...  grant despised the way he spoke to his mother, it ate at his core, it enraged him...  his mother was reduced to tears, and the cunt swiftly asked her to get back to work and close the door behind her, with tears still streaming from her eyes... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>"I don’t know why but I ran quickly toward the toilet for mummy not to see me" he tells his sister that evening while chilling in her room "naaiers!" she replies softly enough for her mom not to hear her cussing "I didn’t know mummy was working for such naaiers, she then always say work is amazing and stuff, she then <strong>never</strong> complains... ." he’s left with a sobering thought that he shares with his sis "mummy worked there for like 30 years almost, and everyday she sieker had to versak for that naaiers, she can’t mos wys that bra, yay your poes chack keep your vark job! nai bra...  she must versak, and everyday when she versak for that ma se poeste, i think to myself...  YOR...  she’s versaking for us" and they both have a moment, it was more of a combined appreciation, their thoughts both pushing out intentions of gratitude toward their mother... </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>at that very same moment, while stirring her tea in the kitchen, their mother smiled out loud to herself, thinking about the two of them, and how they were the most precious things in the world to her...  from that day on grant’s behaviour toward his mother changed, his mother could never really understand what had suddenly happened to all his anger, he had somehow found a new channel in which to displace his energies, his anger was transmuted to purpose, his mother’s happiness was the only thing keeping him anchored...  although she attributes the changes in her son to her prayers being answered...  </p>
		      <br />
		      <p>it was on that day, replaying that scene in his mother’s poes boss’ office that he decided to change the world that his mother lived in...  he knew that changing the whole world was as easy as changing the thoughts in his own head, his mother was living proof – a small part of grant wanted to kill his mom’s boss, not in a figurative sort of way, he contemplated killing him for realsies...  but aweh</p>

		      <p>free schooling is aligning to the feeling that no one should ever have to pay to access the knowledge it took us a few billion years to accumulate. we totally need better ways to share knowledge and less ways to make each other pay for something we ourselves know to be collective knowledge, deep deep deep down in our souls...  its mos one love, just because your imagination can’t stretch into the future doesn’t make things the way they are right now right or wrong, beyond ideas of wrong-doing and right-doing there is a field, I’ll meet you there</p>
		      <br />
		      <p>I meditate everyday, but not like you think, you don’t need to buy a vark yoga mat and then think you’re soema gonna meditate now, nai bra jus, that’s poes praat, the doorways be infinite, you will find your own form of meditation...  meditation is just another word for <strong>full immersion</strong>, there’s nothing more to it...  your meditation for example can just be ten minutes of pure and focused drawing, rowing, swimming, building, creating, whatever you choose, irrespective, to get lost in your activity or non-activity is meditation...  its clear to see where lionel messi’s meditation is, the bra has a soccer ball lodged in his brain, in his heart, in his very being...  your meditation should be as clear to the next human, without opening your bek evens...  and always remembering that greatness without feeling or taking responsibility, is dik brasse with one love... </p>

		      <p>my neice asked me the other day while watching me ‘be quiet’ – "what are you doing, why don’t you speak?" it was hard not to feel her want to know, so I broke my concentration and told her "when I’m so quiet, then I can remember stuff" puzzled, she asks "like what stuff are you trying to remember?" I tell her to close her eyes and she does "when you don’t think your own thoughts, when you just sit and listen, and try to make the noise in your mind quiet, you are reminded of something, meditation is trying to remember that you are one with everything and trying to mediate is bringing you closer to that feeling of oneness, a feeling that lifts your spirit...  do you know what I mean?", she keeps her eyes closed and nods "meditating is like trying to remember...  does that make since? you don’t need to pay anyone to learn how to meditate, that’s like paying someone to teach you how to love... " she nods with her eyes still shut and breaks the silence with "cummy go buy ice-cream... " to which I replied "what flavour?" and although it seemed as if she was listening to me, she had become fully immersed in the thought of her mind’s want for some chocolate flavoured ice-cream... </p>

		      <p>oom jan was part of the saps since the sixties, he’s quite the racist and openly so. I remember one day at his home, he shouted at his presumably african gardener, in a tone that was neither necessary or justified... "waar'de'fok, maak skoen teen die kante van die flower beds ook" and with his most refined english accent as if trying on a jacket continues with "...and what is that overgrowth jotting out on the sides like that, clean that up too" and in the same breath turns to his 13 year old dog and whispers "wies oupa se brakkie? wies pa se brakkie?! wies oupa se brakkie?!" as if talking to a 6 month old baby. I love oom, he’s full of love, I can see it when he speaks to the dog... he truly is one the kindest humans on the planet, his perspective limits him from targeting the general population with his affection though. neverthemore, he is my oom, our brother and we are experiencing this one love together</p>
